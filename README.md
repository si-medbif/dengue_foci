## About
A project aims to count numbers and measure areas of dengue foci from focus forming assay (FFA) by computer vision technology `(OpenCV)`. The specificity of the developed foci detection program is 93.75%. The R-value of the correlation between the foci measured by program and human-measured is 0.993. However, the number measured by the program significantly less than the average human-measured is 2.4 foci.
