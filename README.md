## About
A project aims to count numbers and measure areas of dengue foci from focus forming assay (FFA) by computer vision technology (OpenCV). The specificity of the developed foci detection program is 93.75%. The R-value of the correlation between the foci measured by program and human-measured is 0.993. However, the number measured by the program significantly less than the average human-measured is 2.4 foci.
